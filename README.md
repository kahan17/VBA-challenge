# VBA-challenge

# The VBA script calculates and displays quarterly stock metrics, including the ticker symbol, quarterly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock in the worksheet.

The script loops through each stock for the given quarter, calculating the quarterly change (difference between the opening price at the beginning of the quarter and the closing price at the end of the quarter). The percentage change is computed. The total stock volume for each stock is also calculated. The script identifies the stock with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume.
